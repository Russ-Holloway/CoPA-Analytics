# Automated Function Deployment Solution

## Problem
The "Deploy to Azure" button creates infrastructure but doesn't automatically load function code, requiring manual ZIP deployment via Kudu.

## Solution Applied
Updated the ARM template with several enhancements to enable true one-click deployment:

### 1. Enhanced App Settings
Added critical settings for reliable package deployment:
```json
{
    "name": "WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE",
    "value": "https://github.com/Russ-Holloway/CoPPA-Analytics/raw/main/chatbot-analytics-azure-deploy/function-app.zip"
},
{
    "name": "WEBSITE_SKIP_CONTENTSHARE_VALIDATION", 
    "value": "1"
},
{
    "name": "SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT",
    "value": "true"
},
{
    "name": "ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD",
    "value": "true"
}
```

### 2. Post-Deployment Script
Added automated restart script to ensure package loads properly:
- Waits 60 seconds for initial deployment
- Restarts Function App to trigger package extraction
- Ensures all 6 functions are detected

### 3. Key Configuration Changes
- **Linux Function App**: `"kind": "functionapp,linux"`
- **Python 3.11 Runtime**: `"linuxFxVersion": "Python|3.11"`
- **Proper Build Settings**: Oryx build enabled for Python dependencies
- **Package URL**: Direct GitHub raw link to function-app.zip

## Expected User Experience
1. Click "Deploy to Azure" button
2. Fill in parameters (force prefix, email)
3. Wait 5-8 minutes for deployment
4. Functions automatically appear in Function App
5. All 6 functions ready to use immediately

## Troubleshooting
If functions still don't appear automatically:
1. Check Deployment Center logs
2. Verify WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE URL is accessible
3. Manual restart via Azure Portal may be needed

## Files Modified
- `azuredeploy.json` - Enhanced with deployment automation
- Function package URL updated to point to GitHub

This eliminates the need for manual Kudu deployment and provides a true one-click experience for end users.
