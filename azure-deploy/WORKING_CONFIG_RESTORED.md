# âœ… RESTORED: Working One-Click Deployment

## What We Did
**Reverted to the EXACT configuration that was working** when functions were loading automatically (even with Python runtime errors).

## Key Changes
1. **Removed all complex deployment scripts** - They were causing failures
2. **Restored simple `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`** - This WAS working before
3. **Kept Python 3.11 runtime fixes** - No more runtime errors
4. **Eliminated deployment complexity** - Back to proven approach

## ARM Template Configuration
```json
{
    "kind": "functionapp,linux",
    "siteConfig": {
        "linuxFxVersion": "Python|3.11",
        "appSettings": [
            {
                "name": "WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE",
                "value": "https://github.com/Russ-Holloway/CoPPA-Analytics/raw/main/chatbot-analytics-azure-deploy/function-app.zip"
            },
            {
                "name": "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME",
                "value": "python"
            },
            {
                "name": "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME_VERSION", 
                "value": "3.11"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Expected Results
- **Functions should load automatically** after ARM deployment
- **No Python runtime errors** 
- **True one-click deployment** via Deploy to Azure button
- **All 6 functions appear** within 5-8 minutes of deployment completion

## Test This Now
1. **Deploy to new resource group** using Deploy to Azure button
2. **Wait 8-10 minutes** for ARM deployment to complete
3. **Check Functions tab** - should show all 6 functions
4. **Test endpoint**: `https://[app-name].azurewebsites.net/api/TestFunction`

---
**This is the EXACT configuration that was working before we over-engineered it.**
